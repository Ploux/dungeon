* You're the green sad face
* Pink/red sad faces = orcs or goblins (I'm not sure which is which)
* Purple sad faces are definitely dragons. Save these for last, after you've leveled up some.
* The squares with circles in them are treasures. Gold, health, or sword. Counterintuitively, they all just give you points.
* After you fight all the monsters, and collect all the treasures, you've won.
* By won, I mean you're now stuck in this dungeon forever, until you close the game. No wonder everyone's sad.
