## Recent Improvements
* Added message window. (Use PgUp and PgDn to scroll.)
* Replaced numeric tuples with color constants in the code. Discovered that the light red saddies are goblins. Dark red are orcs. Goblins are weaker than orcs.
* Removed WASD movement; added numpad.
* Removed directions that were covering part of the screen.

## TODO
- [ ] make fights a turn-by-turn affair
- [ ] make items actually work

- [ ] inventory
- [ ] spite graphics
- [ ] more levels
- [ ] more types of monsters
- [ ] more types of equipment
- [ ] moving monsters
- [ ] better generation of levels / starting location not always in top left corner

* You're the green sad face
* Light/dark red sad faces = orcs or goblins (I'm not sure which is which)
* Purple sad faces are definitely dragons. Save these for last, after you've leveled up some.
* The squares with circles in them are treasures. Gold, health, or sword. Counterintuitively, they all just give you points.
* After you fight all the monsters, and collect all the treasures, you've won.
* By won, I mean you're now stuck in this dungeon forever, until you close the game. No wonder everyone's sad.
